Steps to Remove Expired Trial Licenses Using PowerShell
Step 1: Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run: Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
Step 2: Connect to Microsoft Graph
Run: Connect-MgGraph -Scopes Organization.ReadWrite.All
Sign in with your Global Admin credentials.
Complete the authentication

Step 3: Check All Subscribed SKUs
Run: Get-MgSubscribedSku | Select SkuId, SkuPartNumber, SubscriptionIds, ConsumedUnits
 
This will list all licenses in your tenant, including expired trials.
Look for SkuPartNumber containing “Trial” or check the Status.
Step 4: Identify Expired Trial Subscriptions
Run: Get-MgSubscription | Select Id, Status, SkuId
Status will show Disabled or Expired for trials.
Note down the Subscription Id for expired trials.
Step 5: Remove Expired Trial Subscriptions
Run: Remove-MgSubscription -SubscriptionId <SubscriptionId>
Replace <SubscriptionId> with the actual ID from Step 4.
Step 6: Verify Removal
Run: Get-MgSubscription | Select Id, Status
Ensure expired trials are no longer listed.
 
Important Notes
You need Global Admin rights to perform these steps.
Repeat Step 5 for each expired trial subscription.
Removing expired trials does not affect active licenses.
